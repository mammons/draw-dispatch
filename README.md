# DrawDispatch

This is an in-development demo application builT with Angular and served with a very simple Express server. It is used to assign tasks and track operators. You can assign a task and tower to an operator and complete that task with a result. Doing so increments the count for the operator. Once the task is complete, additional comments can be added to the task if desired.

Development build running at: https://draw-dispatch.herokuapp.com/
